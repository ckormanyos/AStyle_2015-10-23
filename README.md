# Artisitic Style Utility (2015)

__DISCLAIMER__: The code files in this repository are not my work,
and are officially available at
[gitlab.com/saalen/astyle](https://gitlab.com/saalen/astyle)

This repository maintains and supports an older version of
[gitlab.com/saalen/astyle](https://gitlab.com/saalen/astyle)
from sometime in the year 2015. At that taime, the program
did (and still does) a wonderful job formatting
C/C++ code, which is basically all that I need or want.
I was so happy with this version, that I froze it here.
